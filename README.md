# NetNinny
Computer Networks - Assignment 2

The purpose of this assignment is to learn about the World Wide Web and the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Along the way, you will also learn about TCP/IP and socket programming in C++.

Imagine that you are a conscientious Internet user who wishes to protect your friends and family from viewing inappropriate Web content. In particular, you want them to avoid any Web pages that might insult their intelligence. Specific examples that may come to mind are Web pages that mention SpongeBob, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, or Norrk??ping. You must do your best to prevent their Web browsers from viewing these sites. 

Your solution will build upon your knowledge of Web proxies and HTTP, coupled with a few simple rules for URL-based and content-based filtering of Web pages. Since the content filtering is not all that sophisticated, we will refer to this simple software as the "Net Ninny".
